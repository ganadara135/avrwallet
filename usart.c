/** \file usart.c

  * \brief Implements stream I/O using the AVR's USART.
  *
  * This allows the host to communicate with the AVR over a serial link.
  * On some Arduinos, the USART is connected to a USB-to-serial bridge,
  * allowing the host to communicate with the AVR over a USB connection.
  * See initUsart() for serial communication parameters.
